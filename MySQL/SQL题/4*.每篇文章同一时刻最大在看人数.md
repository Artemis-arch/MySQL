# 解答

```mysql
select artical_id, max(sum_cge) as max_uv
from
(
select *, sum(cge) over(partition by artical_id order by t, cge desc) as sum_cge
from
(
    select artical_id, in_time as t, 1 as cge
    from tb_user_log
    where artical_id != 0
    union all 
    select artical_id, out_time as t, -1 as cge
    from tb_user_log
    where artical_id != 0
) as tb ) as tb1
group by artical_id order by max_uv desc
```

# 总结

第一次遇到求所有时刻中的最大值。要找到加入的时刻+1，退出的时刻-1，然后再窗口求和，得到某一时刻的值，再max求最大值
